With relatively small datasets, it doesn't matter that the field isn't indexed.

At enterprise scale, the bigger barrier is getting people to agree on what you should be trying to make. There are easily two hours of talking about what you should do for every one hour of doing it. </p> <p>The only thing worse than all that talking is not doing the talking. In that case, you are likely to find that the thing you built is not the thing you need. One way or another, you'll need to have the conversation and get everyone to agree on a shared goal.</p> <p>Commitment to a shared goal is hard because people disagree. That means you need a method of productive disagreement. If somebody proposes something that seems like a bad idea, you need to be able to raise the concern or else you risk shipping poor quality output. If the group keeps arguing in circles without arriving at an agreement, you don't ship anything. </p> <p>One common mode of unproductive disagreement is to argue about things that aren't important. This is commonly called \"bike-shedding\", because it's the equivalent of arguing about the color of a bike shed at a nuclear power plant instead of arguing about the reactor design. Recognize and interrupt bike-shedding when you see it to help bring the conversation back to topics that actually matter.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there aren't many strong rules for what a system of productive disagreement might look like. The best option depends heavily on the culture of the organization and the nature of the relationships you have with the people you're disagreeing with. It will probably take several iterations to arrive at something that works. And if the group changes, like a new hire comes on board, you will likely have to tweak whatever system you have.</p> <p>For my current team, our method of productive disagreement is to build prototypes without much discussion ahead of time. People react to the prototype and suggest changes. Sometimes those changes involve throwing the entire prototype away and starting from scratch with a new approach. This is good for us because we are otherwise prone to bike-shedding. The prototype becomes a psychological anchor for unimportant details and it's easier to let go of those arguments and focus on what's important. This approach requires that people building prototypes are open to critical feedback and willing to make changes instead of getting invested in their original choices. Viewing feedback as a gift is something most people are quite bad at, but happens to be a strength of my current team.</p> <p>Regardless of what you eventually create, you should think explicitly about how to work through disagreements.

Both of us learned more over time, but we were embarrassed about some of the terrible code we had written earlier in our careers. We wrote this workshop to be the one we wish we had attended years ago.</p> <p>This workshop focuses on a few specific patterns that we think are good for geospatial professionals:</p> <ul> <li>Unpacking</li> <li>Using try/except</li> <li>More extensive use of Python built ins and standard library</li> <li>Context managers</li> <li>Using more tuples and sets instead of lists</li> <li>Iterators</li> <li>Generators </li> <li>Code profiling</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2025/05/28/resume/","title":"Resume","text":"<p>My resume is a web app with some interactivity provided by CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. Updates to the resume trigger a GitHub Action to publish the resume to GitHub Pages and a CloudFlare worker that publishes the resume to a custom domain CloudFlare page.</p> <p> </p> <p> See project</p> <p> Explore repository</p> <p>This resume is part of my attempt to complete the Cloud Resume Challenge using no paid resources other than registering a custom domain. Originally hosted in a storage blob in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, I migrated this project to CloudFlare to take advantage of automatic publishing to a custom domain.</p> <p>One big lesson for me from creating this resume is that it requires far more custom CSS and HTML than I care to create. Even though I started with a template created by somebody else, customizing it to my liking was time consuming. Relative to paying for hosting and using something like WordPress, it will probably take at least 10 years to recoup my initial time investment. It would probably be worth it for somebody who wanted to learn more about customizing HTML and CSS, but not for anybody else.</p>"},{"location":"category/arcgis-enterprise/","title":"ArcGIS Enterprise","text":""},{"location":"category/arcgis-online/","title":"ArcGIS Online","text":""},{"location":"category/teaching/","title":"Teaching","text":""},{"location":"category/css/","title":"CSS","text":""},{"location":"category/github-actions/","title":"GitHub Actions","text":""},{"location":"category/html/","title":"HTML","text":""},{"location":"category/javascript/","title":"JavaScript","text":""},{"location":"category/data-analysis/","title":"Data analysis","text":""},{"location":"category/data-engineering/","title":"Data engineering","text":""},{"location":"category/jupyter-notebooks/","title":"Jupyter Notebooks","text":""},{"location":"category/python/","title":"Python","text":""},{"location":"category/arcgis-pro/","title":"ArcGIS Pro","text":""},{"location":"category/yaml/","title":"YAML","text":""},{"location":"category/bash/","title":"Bash","text":""},{"location":"category/kubernetes/","title":"Kubernetes","text":""},{"location":"category/arcgis-arcade/","title":"ArcGIS Arcade","text":""},{"location":"category/cartography/","title":"Cartography","text":""},{"location":"category/docker/","title":"Docker","text":""},{"location":"page/2/","title":"All projects","text":""},{"location":"page/3/","title":"All projects","text":""},{"location":"category/teaching/page/2/","title":"Teaching","text":""}]}
