This training seminar was so much fun to put together. Derek Nelson and I decided early on that we wanted it to play much more fast and loose than other Esri training seminars had done. We wanted it to reflect the playful spirit of Python, and we wanted to normalize the failure that everybody regularly experiences when writing code. We had earned enough trust from our colleagues that they supported our vision, even though it was riskier than playing it straight. 

Derek and I were sure the risk would pay off, and we were right. This training seminar had the highest attendence and highest participant rating of any live training seminar Esri had done since rolling out a new format in 2023. And when we had technical failures right in the middle of the live seminar in front of thousands of people, we were able to roll right with it because of how we had internalized our own lessons. Failures are inevitable. Success cannot rely on perfection.
