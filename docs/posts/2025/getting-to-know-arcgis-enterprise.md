# Getting to Know ArcGIS Enterprise

This the the first book published by Esri Press on ArcGIS Enterprise, which I co-authored with Jon Emch and Diana Muresan. It contains a mix of conceptual content and hands-on exercises for people learning to be ArcGIS Enterprise administrators.

This book was motivated by two things:

0. My many conversations with geospatial professionals who got into the industry to make maps and do analysis, but found themselves thrown into the role of GIS administrators and felt over their head.
0. The lack of enterprise-level thinking and practice in my graduate program.

My hope is that the book can be used to address both issues. It can demystify some important concepts for existing administrators who are trying to keep their head above water. It can also serve as part of a university course on how to manage GIS systems across an organization for students who are entering the profession.

My contributions to the book include authoring several chapters:

- Chapter 3: Deploying ArcGIS Enterprise
- Chapter 6: Getting familiar with the ArcGIS Enterprise portal
- Chapter 7: Managing users in ArcGIS Enterprise
- Chapter 8: Manage content in the ArcGIS Enterprise portal
- Chapter 16: Performance best practices
- Chapter 20: Upgrading ArcGIS Enterprise

I also created or extended several of the exercises throughout the book.
