# Resume

My resume is a web app with some interactivity provided by CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. Updates to the resume trigger a GitHub Action to publish the resume to GitHub Pages and a CloudFlare worker that publishes the resume to a custom domain CloudFlare page.

This resume is part of my attempt to complete the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/) using no paid resources other than registering a custom domain. Originally hosted in a storage blob in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, I migrated this project to CloudFlare to take advantage of automatic publishing to a custom domain.

One big lesson for me from creating this resume is that it requires far more custom CSS and HTML than I care to create. Even though I started with a template created by somebody else, customizing it to my liking was time consuming. Relative to paying for hosting and using something like WordPress, it will probably take at least 10 years to recoup my initial time investment. It would probably be worth it for somebody who wanted to learn more about customizing HTML and CSS, but not for anybody else.
