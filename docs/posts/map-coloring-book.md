During the early part of the COVID pandemic, adult coloring books suddenly became popular. For many people, it was a way to focus on something non-horrible while the rest of the world seemed to be falling apart. Some of these were color-by-number apps where you would choose a color and the app would highlight all the areas that should be that color. 

That seemed like a model that would be interesting to use to explore data on a choropleth map. Pick the color of a class break, then see all the regions that belong to that class. 

From this project, I learned that if you're manually manipulating svg, you're probably doing it wrong.
