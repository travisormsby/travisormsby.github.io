This isn't the most complex project I've worked on, but it is the only project where I had to handle so much complexity on my own. It took several different technologies to engineer the raw data, and several more to create a custom web application visualizing that data. 

Sometimes when you work for a small organization, you need to wear several hats. I this case I was everything from analyst to cartographer to developer. There are serious tradeoffs to that approach however, because a single person is unlikely to be an expert across all of those domains. Time that I devote to becoming an expert in front-end development to improve the web app is time that I can't spend improving my ability to understand the underlying routing model to improve the map-matching.
