My co-presenter Derek Nelson and I built on the success of our earlier Python tips and tricks live training seminar to put together this follow up focused on introducing fundamental Python concepts for people working in ArcGIS. The focus is on the most essential tools for getting started with Python:

- Variables
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Invoking ArcPy functions

As in our earlier LTS, Derek and I used a lighthearted tone and a purposefully less polished presentation to help people feel welcome to Python and make sure they know that making mistakes is part of the journey.
