This was my first live training seminar, and one of the first after Esri restarted the program in late 2023. The focus is on three aspects of Arcade:

- Portability across ArcGIS
- Using Arcade expressions for cartographic products (labels, symbology, popups)
- How profiles affect the language features that are available in different contexts.
