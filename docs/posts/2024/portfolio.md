# Portfolio

The portfolio site you're looking at right now is made with the mkdocs Material theme, and published via GitHub Action to a custom domain hosted by CloudFlare.

:fontawesome-brands-github: 
:simple-yaml:

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Explore repository](https://github.com/travisormsby/travisormsby.github.io){:target="_blank"}

The Blog capabilities of mkdocs-Material are also useful for putting a portfolio together. I appreciate that the individual write-ups are simple markdown files. If I ever need to migrate to some other tooling, I can use the same files.
