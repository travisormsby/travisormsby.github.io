One of the difficult questions I had to think through when creating these notebooks was how much do you need to know about Python in order to teach about Python? 

In some respects, the more I know about Python, the less effective I get at teaching the fundamentals. It's easy to forget how hard it was to learn those concepts in the beginning. The curse of knowledge is real, and if you're not careful you can lose empathy for beginners. 

But you still have to know something. These notebooks represent what I think is the minimum necessary knowledge for teaching Python in ArcGIS.
